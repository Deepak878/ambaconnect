# JobItem Time Display Fix

## Changes Made ✅

### 1. **Moved Time to Bottom Right**
- Removed time from the top header
- Added time display in the bottom right corner of each job card
- Changed footer layout to `flexDirection: 'row'` with `justifyContent: 'space-between'`

### 2. **Removed "Posted" Text**  
- Changed from "Posted 2h ago" to just "2h ago"
- Cleaner, more concise display

### 3. **Improved Layout**
- Header now only shows action buttons on the right (job type icon + save button)
- Footer shows location on left, time on right
- Better space utilization

### 4. **Enhanced Styling**
- Time text is smaller (11px) and muted color
- Better visual balance between location and time information

## Technical Implementation ✅

**Layout Structure:**
```
[Card Header]
  - Empty left space
  - Right actions (type icon + save button)

[Job Title]

[Price/Salary Info]

[Footer]
  - Location (left) | Time (right)

[Tags] (if any)
```

**Time Display Function:**
- Works with ISO string dates
- Handles invalid dates gracefully  
- Shows: "Just now", "5m ago", "2h ago", "3d ago", "2w ago"
- Returns empty string for missing/invalid dates

The JobItem component now displays the posting time in the bottom right corner as requested, without the word "Posted" - just showing the time elapsed like "2d ago", "1w ago", etc.
