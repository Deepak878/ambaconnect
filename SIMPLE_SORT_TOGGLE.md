# Simple Sort Toggle Implementation

## What was implemented:

### Single Toggle Button
- **Initial state**: "By Distance" (sorts nearest to farthest)
- **After click**: "By Time" (sorts latest to oldest)
- **After click again**: Back to "By Distance"

### Button Behavior:
```
Click 1: "By Distance" → "By Time"
Click 2: "By Time" → "By Distance"
Click 3: "By Distance" → "By Time"
... and so on
```

### Layout:
```
[All] [Jobs] [Accommodation] [Part-time]        [By Distance]
```

### Sorting Logic:

#### By Distance (nearest to farthest):
- Items with distance calculation come first
- Sorted from closest to furthest away
- Items without distance go to the end

#### By Time (latest to oldest):
- Items with valid dates come first
- Sorted from newest to oldest posting time
- Items without dates go to the end
- Handles both Firestore timestamps and regular dates

### Removed Complexity:
- ❌ Multiple distance filter buttons (5km, 15km, etc.)
- ❌ Multiple time filter buttons (today, week, month)  
- ❌ Complex filter combinations
- ✅ One simple toggle button that everyone can understand

### Code Changes:
1. **State**: Replaced complex filter states with single `sortBy` state
2. **Logic**: Simplified filtering to just basic filters + one sort toggle
3. **UI**: Clean single-row layout with toggle button at the end
4. **Sorting**: Robust sorting that handles missing/invalid data gracefully

This is much cleaner and more intuitive than the previous complex filtering system!
